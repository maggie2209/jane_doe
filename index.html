Just outside of Tamworth in country New South Wales, a freight train hits someone lying on the tracks. The boy on the tracks is Mark Haines, a 17 year-old Gomeroi teenager. Despite the strange evidence found at the scene of his death, the family feel like they're being ignored by police. An inquiry finds no answers and the mystery is left to fester, causing division and suspicion in the town. Season 2 is Barrenjoey Road,. On a regular Saturday night in June 1978, 18-year-old Trudie leaves a party at Newport Surf Club just after midnight. Thumbing a ride on Barrenjoey Road, she is picked up... and never seen again. But Trudie's disappearance is just the start of this mystery. In the weeks and months after she goes missing, other women come forward to tell the police terrifying stories of abduction and rape.

But Adnan has always maintained he had nothing to do with Hae’s death. Some people believe he's telling the truth. Many others don't.</p>
